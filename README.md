# AntiparticleDM-lite

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.815457.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.815457)

**Note:** This repo is identical to [AntiparticleDM](https://github.com/bradkav/AntiparticleDM), but without the data in the `results` folder, for size reasons.

Python code for calculating the prospects of future direct detection experiments to discriminate between Majorana and Dirac Dark Matter (i.e. to determine whether Dark Matter is its own antiparticle). Direct detection event rates and mock data generation are taken care of by a variation of the `WIMpy` code - available [here](https://github.com/bradkav/WIMpy/tree/Antiparticle).

With this code, the results of arXiv:XXXX.XXXXX should be ***entirely reproducible***. Follow the instructions [below](#repro) if you want to reproduce those results. If you find any mistakes or have any trouble at all reproducing any of the results, please open an issue or get in touch directly.

If you have any questions, comments, bug-reports etc., please contact Bradley Kavanagh at bradkav@gmail.com. 

#### Version History

**Version 1.0 (23/06/2017):** Initial release, including all results and plots from the paper.

## Contents

- `calc`: core code for calculating the statistical significance for discriminating between Dirac and Majorana Dark Matter (DM).
- `scripts`: scripts for reproducing results from the paper (NB: some may need to be implemented on a computing cluster...)
- `analysis`: scripts for processing the results and generating plots.
- `results`: data products for a range of DM masses, couplings and experimental ensembles.
- `plots`: plots from arXiv:XXXX.XXXXX (and others).

## Reproducing the results <a name="repro"></a>

The majority of the code is written in `python`, and requires the standard `numpy` and `scipy` libraries. For plotting, `matplotlib` is also required. Code for generating mock data sets and performing likelihood fits are found in the `calc` folder. Check the README in the `calc` folder for (slightly) more detail on how it works.

#### Performing likelihood fits

For calculating the discrimination significance for a single point in parameter space, check out [`calc/index.ipynb`](calc/index.ipynb).

For calculating the discrimination significance over a grid of the input couplings, an example scripts is given in  [`scripts/RunFits_couplings.sh`](scripts/RunFits_couplings.sh). 

For calculating the discrimination significance as a function of exposure (for a fixed input), an example script is given in [`scripts/RunFits_exposure.sh`](scripts/RunFits_exposure.sh).

Note that these scripts will take a long time to run (think hours to days...). In practice then, you'll probably want to run things on a computing cluster. For this, we provide two python files [`scripts/RunMPI_couplings.py`](scripts/RunMPI_couplings.py) and [`scripts/RunMPI_exposure.py`](scripts/RunMPI_exposure.py), which are MPI-enabled and take care of running large numbers of fits in parallel. To use these, `mpi4py` is required.

#### Generating plots

Scripts for generating plots from the results are in the `analysis/` folder. To (re-)generate all the plots from the paper, simply run `scripts/GeneratePlots.sh`.

#### Checking the likelihood calculator

You can also check that the likelihood calculator works well by running 

```python
python CompareNgrid.py mx
```

in the `calc` folder (where `mx` is the DM mass in GeV). This will calculate the maximum likelihood as a function of mass for different densities of grid (showing hopefully that the case of a 50x50x50 grid for Dirac DM works well). There are also some plots to this effect in the `plots` folder.
